# 16-BIt Microprocessr in Verilog

Prototype of Accumulator based MICROPROCESSOR using Von Neumann Architecture

## Problem Statement
### Problem Statement 1
Read the complete Problem Statement [here](https://github.com/Fangzzxx/ICHIP-PS2/blob/main/I-Chip%20PS1.pdf).
- In Problem Statement 1, we were assigned to design CalC which will perform arithmetic and logical operations on 8-bit digital inputs and return an 8-bit digital output.

</p>

- 7 Control Bits are given as input to the CalC, where each control signal represents a basic operation on inputs as mentioned.

### Problem Statement 2
Read the complete Problem Statement [here](https://github.com/Fangzzxx/ICHIP-PS2/blob/main/I-Chip%20PS2.pdf).
- In Problem Statement 2, we were assigned the task of designing a prototype of a complete microprocessor using the CalC in PS1 as the ALU.

- The microprocessor is supposed to follow **Von Neumann Architecture** and should be an accumulator based processor (The output of ALU is always stored in the accumulator).

## Testing
- You will be provided two text files, [Program file](https://github.com/Fangzzxx/ICHIP-PS2/blob/main/Program.txt) and [Data file](https://github.com/Fangzzxx/ICHIP-PS2/blob/main/Data.txt). One contained the set of instructions to be executed. Other contained the data to be stored in the memory.
- We had to Upload the program in the code segment of the Memory and the data in the data segment of the Memory.
- We Created a testbench with a clock cycle of 100 MHz and executed all the instructions in a sequential order. After complete execution of all the instructions, the data segment of Memory was written in an output.txt [file](https://github.com/Fangzzxx/ICHIP-PS2/blob/main/Memory_Output.txt).
